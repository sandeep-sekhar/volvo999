Churn Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn can help the company identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [provide dataset source]. It contains information about [describe dataset features].

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

data/: Directory containing the dataset and any other data files.
notebooks/: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
src/: Directory containing source code for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
models/: Directory containing trained model artifacts.
reports/: Directory containing project reports, visualizations, and documentation.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone [repository_url].
Navigate to the project directory: cd churn-prediction.
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Explore the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Modeling: Train machine learning models on the training data to predict churn. Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics.
Evaluation: Assess model performance and identify the best-performing model for deployment.
Deployment: Deploy the chosen model in a production environment for real-time churn prediction.
